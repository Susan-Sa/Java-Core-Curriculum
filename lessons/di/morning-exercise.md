# Morning Exercises

***For each of the following exercises, complete the exercise AND calculate the worst-case runtime in Big-O notation of your solution***

1. Write a method `xToNum(x, num)` that takes two numbers: **x** and **num** as arguments and returns the sum of all numbers from **x** to **num** (including both). For example:

```java
xToNum(4, 8)  // = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 30
```

2. Write a method called `checkUnique(String input)` that takes in a string as an argument and checks if the string has all unique characters. In other words, the method should check to make sure there are no duplicate characters in the string. If the string's characters are all unique, the method should return true. Otherwise it should return false.

3. Write a method insertAfter(Node node, Node newNode) that inserts newNode directly after the existing node in a singly-linked list.
