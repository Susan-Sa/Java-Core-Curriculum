***For the following exercise, complete the exercise and please send me the repo link***

## Resources 

- [Creating a REST Service with Spring](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/)
- [The NYT Top Stories API](https://api.nytimes.com/svc/topstories/v2/home.json?api-key=5Juyps8ID6qTGAC1bcsuk00GB6RfOzer)

Consider the following image of the New York Times Top Stories JSON of the results from the home section:

Based off of what we currently know of JSON objects and how they can be mapped to Java Objects, as well as how to create a simple JSON using Spring, please create an identical JSON body on local server with Spring. Please refer to the ***"Creating a REST Service with Spring"*** lesson for a reminder on how to create a REST Service with Spring

***Note*** The values in your JSON do not have to match with the examples given above, sample data is accepted. See the NYT Top Stories API link in resources for a closer look at the example.
